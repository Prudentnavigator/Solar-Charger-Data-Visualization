Help on module csv_due:

NAME
    csv_due

DESCRIPTION
    This module checks the days passed between the last SolarHistory.csv data that
      was added, and today. As the Victron Charger only stores data up to 29 days,
      it let's the user know if more data needs to be added so as to not have data
      gaps.

FUNCTIONS
    check_last_update() -> int | dict
        Checks for how many days passed since the last
        time data was added.

    time_to_add_csv() -> bool
        This function returns, if days passed exceed 20 days (csv_alert = True)
          or if days passed exceed 25 days (csv_urgent =True), otherwise both
          variables return False.

DATA
    csv = 'Victron/solarhistory.csv'
    file_size = 13006
    logger = <Logger csv_due (DEBUG)>
    parent_dir = 'Victron'

FILE
